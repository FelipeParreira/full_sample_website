# Sample app with gallery

This is the full finished application (with a functional/interactive image gallery) after the final chapter of [*Learn Enough JavaScript to Be Dangerous*](https://www.learnenough.com/javascript-tutorial) by Michael Hartl, based on the sample application developed in [*Learn Enough CSS & Layout to Be Dangerous*](https://www.learnenough.com/css-and-layout-tutorial) by Lee Donahoe and Michael Hartl.

After downloading the repository, you can run the app using the `jekyll` static site builder:

```
$ jekyll serve
```

At that point, the app will be running on [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). To deploy your app, push up the app (repo) to GitHub Pages as [described](https://www.learnenough.com/css-and-layout-tutorial/css/introduction/sample_site_setup) in [*Learn Enough CSS & Layout to Be Dangerous*](https://www.learnenough.com/css-and-layout-tutorial).
